# RancherOS

It's containers all the way down!  Everything is powered by Docker (I mean everything).

## Building

    ./build.sh

## Running

KVM, VirtualBox, and VMware all supported.  Just boot from the `rancheros.iso`

## Commands

*docker* -- Good old Docker, you that to run stuff.
*system-docker* -- The docker instance running the system containers
