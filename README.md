# RancherOS

It's containers all the way down!  Everything is powered by Docker (I mean everything).

## Building

Docker 1.5+ required.

    ./build.sh

## Running

KVM, VirtualBox, and VMware all supported.  Just boot from the `rancheros.iso`

## Commands

`docker` -- Good old Docker, use that to run stuff.

`system-docker` -- The docker instance running the system containers
